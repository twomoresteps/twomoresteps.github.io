# üçÅ Autumn

Autumn is a minimalistic, duo-chromatic [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that pairs a prominent headline with two column content.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This theme should work as-is, but is no longer actively maintained. [Contributions](#contributing) are welcome!

## Usage

You'll need to have [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), the `bundler` gem, and [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) (`npm` also works) installed on our computer. Autumn provides a fully furnished Jekyll setup ‚Äî just clone and install the dependencies:

```bash
# Ruby gems
bundle install
# Node modules
yarn
```

Then simply run `yarn start` to start the Jekyll server on port `4000`.

## Options

Autumn includes some customizable options, applied via options in the `_config.yml` file. A standout feature is the dark theme.
Have a look at the [`_config.yml`](_config.yml) file for all available options.
