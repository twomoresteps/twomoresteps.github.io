You’re sitting in your apartment, on your freshly cleaned sheets, with pumpkin candles burning, and an old book that’s new to you in your hands. It’s just warm enough that you can leave the window open, and as you read, a breeze of crisp air flows through, and pushes the pages forward. You’re wearing warm socks and a big sweater, and you’re waiting for something to be done in the oven, something you’ve made for someone to come share with you — that someone with whom you’d like to analogize your relationship to blooming like spring, but you know it’s more accurately that you’re settling into each other’s warmth you embrace this change, just like you do autumn.
